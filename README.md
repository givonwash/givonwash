# Welcome! I am Givon.

I am a fellow traveler, lifelong learner, and software engineer trying their best to build a better
world üå±

I am passionate, but certainly not the most well-versed üòÜ, about mathematics, philosophy, computer
science, and history! My professional experience has been primarily as a Data Engineer with
extensive experience managing/working with:

- [Amazon Web Services (abbr. AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Data Build Tool (abbr. DBT)](https://www.getdbt.com/)
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

In practice, these skills/tools/etc. have been put to use in:

- building diverse fault-tolerant, business-critical ETL/ELT pipelines
- provisioning AWS infrastructure for the aforementioned ETL/ELT pipelines as well as other
  business-critical services
- constructing shared data models between analytics and engineering to ensure accurate and efficient
  reporting from data warehousing solutions
- creating data-centric developer tooling to eliminate tens of tedious man-hours spent on
  automatable tasks

Disjoint from the skills/tools enumerated above, my other interests and hobbies of note include:

- [`nix`](https://nixos.org/) and deterministic build systems
- The [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) and its uses in statically typed
  programming languages today
- Powerlifting üèãÔ∏è

## Want To See Some Code?

Check out [givonwash/melt](https://github.com/givonwash)! It's a small-ish Data Engineering-centric
sample passion project that mixes some of the skills/tools/etc. used in my past professional
experience with some of my current interests at the moment (e.g., Kubernetes). The project
demonstrates competency with DBT, TypeScript (and related tooling), Python, Kubernetes, Argo
Workflows, Airbyte, and more!
